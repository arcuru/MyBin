Description:
Write a function, where given a string of arbitrary characters, returns true if all brackets (defined as parentheses, square-brackets, curly-braces, and chevrons) are correctly paired and ordered. This is to say that all brackets, if they enclose other brackets, enclose both the paired opening and closing characters.

Formal Inputs & Outputs:
	Input Description:
		string data - a given string that may or may not have correctly formed brackets.
	Output Description:
		Return True or False - true if the given string is correctly bracket formed.

Sample Inputs & Outputs:
"123","(abc)","()abc()",and "([<{abc123abc}>])" should return true, but "(abc[123)abc]" (wrong pairing) and "(abc>"(not closed) should return false.

Notes:
This is a very easy problem if you use a specific primitive data-structure.
