Intermediate:
Write a function that takes two arguments: a limit, lim, and a list of integers, x. The function counts up from 0 by cycling through x and skipping numbers until we find the next number that's a multiple of x[i]. For example, when x is the list [5, 7, 3], start counting from 0.

*Next multiple of 5 is 5
*Next multiple of 7 is 7
*Next multiple of 3 is 9
*Next multiple of 5 is 10
*Next multiple of 7 is 14
*Next multiple of 3 is 15

When the count reaches lim or a number above it, return the number of steps it took to reach it. (multiple_cycle(15, [5, 7, 3]) would return 6.

What is the result of multiple_cycle(1000000000, [5395, 7168, 2367, 9999, 3])?
